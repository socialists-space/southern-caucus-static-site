            The Southern Caucus was created to represent the shared interests of the chapters and at-large
            members in the historic US South to the DSA National Political Committee (NPC), to chapters in
            other areas, and to rank-and-file DSA members in general.

        <p>
            Building socialism in the South presents unique political and organizing challenges that
            areas with more social democratic influence, like the West Coast or the Northeast, do not
            face. These challenges can result in smaller, more isolated, and less well-funded chapters.
            The working class in the South is often stereotyped as white, male, conservative, and racist;
            erasing the people of color, women, LGBTQ+, and radical working class elements which have
            always played a major role in Southern culture and politics. The South is also very rural, and
            many comrades do not live near a chapter and are unable to start their own.

        <p className='mb1'>More specifically, our purpose is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provide a place for comrades in Southern chapters and at-large comrades to network,
                communicate, and share ideas
            </li>
            <li>
                Coordinate the sharing of resources between Southern chapters such as designs,
                information, money, and experience
            </li>
            <li>Draft policy recommendations to the DSA National Political Committee and proposals for conventions</li>
            <li>Issue statements in response to decisions by the NPC, other caucuses, and other chapters where appropriate to ensure the South is adequately represented and included as DSA continues to grow.</li>
